By: Nandha Gopikannan and Chris Haleas

Questions:

1. What function roughly fits that graph?
The function that fits the graph is f(n) = n^2. Despite there being some inconsistencies, the graph largely aligns with f(n) = n^2.

2. What is the time complexity of your flood() function based on analyzing its code?
